\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 I need to make a program that prints out the frequency of letters in a text file and compares that frequency with that of another in python.\
So far I am able to print the number of times a letter occurs, but the percentage frequency I get is wrong. I think it is because I need my program to count only the number of letters in the file by removing all the spaces and other characters.\
