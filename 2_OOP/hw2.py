# R2.4 - Write a Python class, Flower, that has three instance variables of type str, int, and float, that respectively represent the 
# name of the flower, its number of petals, and its price. Your class must include a constructor method that initializes
# each variable to an appropriate value, and your class should include methods for setting the value of each type, and retrieving
# the value of each type

		return type(self.name), self.name #if currently I take out the return self.name and run the below code below, the correct answer will 
		#still be returned... why? Is it changing the constructor?
		#also return type doesn't return the type, why
